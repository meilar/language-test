## About this project
This site was created to fulfill the requirements of my [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com) code review for introductory JavaScript and jQuery. 

## Features

This page has three sections: an introduction, an assessment quiz, and results. The assessment quiz takes several pieces of input from the user, which results in one of three language results and slightly different text displayed to the user depending on their answers. 

## How to view

To view this webpage:

1. Ensure that you have the most recent version of Git installed. [Instructions can be found here.](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) 
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the Terminal or Bash command `git clone https://github.com/meilar/profile.git`.
2. Open "index.html" in a CSS3 and HTML5-compliant browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Apple Safari.

[Alternately, a hosted version of this pages is available to view on Github Pages.](https://meilar.github.io/language-test)

## Technologies Used

This site incorporates the following frameworks and languages:

- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- Bootstrap 4.5

The following software tools were used to develop this page:

- VS Code
- Google Chrome
- Git

## Known Issues

There are no known issues that prevent any element from loading and displaying correctly. There is one element—range input labels—that only displays correctly in the Chrome browser. For more polish, the next steps I would take to polish this page are:

- add opaque background colors to the intro and quiz background to add some dimensionality to the page and make it feel more modern.
-change the range input question to be something more universally supported like a dropdown menu or radio buttons to ensure compatibility with more browsers. 
- review all custom CSS to ensure that all content and element aligning is using the bootstrap grid system.
