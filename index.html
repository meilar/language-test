      <p>Hi there! I am Morgan Ghufran and over the course of my career I have spent <em>over 10 weeks and hundreds of hours</em> helping talented, motivated candidates like you embrace the grind and manifest the future you want for yourself.</p>
      <p>I have a simple assessment quiz to help me understand your goals and match you with a programming language that suits your individual gifts.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, I... <em>may</em> have had just one too many Santa Margherita Prosecco Superiore frozen peach Bellinis with lunch today. I can't find my answer key, but I'll do my best to remember a good language for you to try.</p>

        <h3>Congratulations, <span></span>! You are now an <span class="lang-name">Airline Food </span> programmer!</h3>
        <p>This programming language was designed to create programs that sound like Jerry Seinfeld's standup routine as captured in the hit TV show <em>Seinfeld</em>.</p>
        <p>For example, to create a variable called <em>x</em>, include the code <code>You ever notice [x]?</code></p>

        <h3>Congratulations, <span></span>! You are now a <span class="lang-name">LOLCODE</span> programmer!</h3>
        <p>This programming language was modeled on the mangled and borderline funny speech included with LOLCAT memes.</p>
        <p>For example, a "hello world" program looks like this:
        <p><pre><code>
          HAI 1.2
          CAN HAS STDIO?
          VISIBLE "HAI WORLD!"
          KTHXBYE</code></pre></p>

        <h3>Congratulations, <span></span>! You are now a <span class="lang-name">Deadfish</span> programmer!</h3>
        <p>Look, I don't know what to tell you. Not everyone is cut out to memorize long lists of functions and methods. Some people yearn for a simpler way. Deadfish was designed to use a single memory cell and only has four functions: <code>i, d, s, o</code>.</p>
